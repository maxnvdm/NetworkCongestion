The commands used to perform the experiment have been compiled into a bash file called run.sh. The experiment can be modified by opening file and adjusting the parameters such as time and bandwidth. By default the time used for each test is set to 120, as this provides a good range for visualising results on a graph but this does mean run.sh will take about 25 minutes. Decrease the time variable for a shorter run-time.

To run the experiment, open a terminal in the network congestion folder and enter:
sudo ./run.sh

After running run.sh, the data and plots from the experiment can be found in the dataplots folder.
